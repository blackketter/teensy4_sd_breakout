A companion breakout board with microSD connector to mate with the [Teensy 4 Header Breakout Board](https://github.com/blackketter/teensy4_header_breakout).  It's designed to solder to the top 9 pins on the left side of the header breakout.  The 9th pin provides an optional card detect (short the solder bridge) on digital pin 29.

Designed in KiCad.
